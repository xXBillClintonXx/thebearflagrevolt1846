<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Introduction </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="+2"> In the year 1846 California was a territory of the Second Federal Republic of Mexico, by 1848 it was under the control of the United States of America. Many reasons went into the United States expansion into California such as "Manifest Destiny" (the belief that it is America's god-ordained right to expand westwards) among many others, such as the Bear Flag Revolt. The revolt was an important factor in the United States eventual annexation of California and the reason that California's flag is what it is today. This website seeks to teach the reasons behind the Bear Flag Revolt, a brief history of the revolt and the revolt's effects on the modern day history of California.
